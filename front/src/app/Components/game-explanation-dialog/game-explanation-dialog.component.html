  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>
    The objective of Lingue Clash is to practice your language skills by
    competing with your friends in a fun and interactive way.
  </p>

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>
    To start playing, one player should create the room, selecting the game
    mode, their language, and their username. Once the room is created, the game
    will share a room code that the other players can use to join. The player
    who created the game can choose the number of rounds, the number of words to
    be used (at least more than the number of rounds), and the words to be used
    in the game. The words can be input by the user or generated by AI.
  </p>

  <h4>Game Modes</h4>
  <p>
    The game has three modes: <b>Solo</b>, <b>Multiplayer</b>, and
    <b>Admin</b> modes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Solo Mode</b> - In this mode, you can play the game alone.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Multiplayer Mode</b> - In this mode, you can play against other players
      in real-time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Admin Mode</b> - In this mode, you can create a room and invite other
      players to join. This is usually used when there is a screen that everyone
      can see.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <p>
    The game is divided into multiple rounds. In each round, you will be
    presented with a number of words in the target language. The number of words
    is currently set to the round number plus one. You will have to form
    sentences from these words. Those sentences will be evaluated by AI (which
    can sometimes give inaccurate evaluations :p). You will be awarded points
    based on the following criteria (with the maximum point being 20):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The number of words you use (-3 points for each word missed)</li>
    <li>The number of spelling mistakes (-1 point for each mistake)</li>
    <li>The number of grammatical mistakes (-2 points for each mistake)</li>
    <li>The number of coherence mistakes (-2 points for each mistake)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
  <p>
    The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. You can track
    your progress and see how you rank against other players.
