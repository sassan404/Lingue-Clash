# Lingue Clash

**Lingue Clash** is an interactive, multiplayer game designed to make learning languages fun, motivating, competitive, and challenging. Players join rooms, compete in rounds, and improve their language skills while playing with their friends.

I got the idea as I was practicing French with my friend who was practicing Arabic, and we weree starting to loose motivation. So I thought I could turn it into a game.
